* Description
# Personal configuration for doom emacs

+ Ready to use with solargraph and rails (with rbenv)
+ Working with JS
+ Some new functions added.

* Prerequisites
 - Git 2.23+
 - Emacs 26.1+ (27 is recommended) with GNUTLS support
 - ripgrep 11.0+
 - GNU find
 - OPTIONAL fd 7.3.0+ (improves file indexing performance for some commands)

* Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/otavioschwanck/doom_emacs_dotfiles.git ~/.doom.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+END_SRC

* Using Autocomplete
On my doom config, i had done several tweaks to the default autocomplete.

Instead of using enter to select the item in the popup, I use TAB.  The Tab can't go down and up in the autocomplete popup.  Instead of tab, i use =C-j= and =C-k=.

| Key     | Command                                                  |
| Tab     | Select the complation                                    |
| C-j     | Go down on the popup                                     |
| C-k     | Go up on the popup                                       |
| C-i     | See only solargraph complations                          |
| C-p     | Select a similar word instantly                          |
| C-S-p   | See the list of similar words                            |
| C-x C-s | See all the snippets                                     |
| C-enter | Toggle snippet / go foward in snippet                    |
| C-d     | (while snipped is active) Delete the highlighted snippet |
